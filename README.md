## What?

These are HTTPSEverywhere rules that force a bunch of sites to be loaded under
their .onion HS equivalent, for the request actually leaves the browser.

Idea taken from [Forcing .onion on Whonix.org](http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/wiki/Forcing_.onion_on_Whonix.org)

## Where?

A reminder to myself that these go here on a Whonix workstation:

```
~/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules
```
